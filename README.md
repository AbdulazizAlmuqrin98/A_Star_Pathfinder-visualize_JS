# A_Star_Pathfinder-visualize_JS
A*  Pathfinder-visualize using java script

The first A star search pathfinding visualizer was implemented in HTML ,CSS and JavaScript ,
the interface of the program consist of the following elements:
•	Grid : this is where the algorithm going to showcase the path generated and visualize the process of the pathfinding .
•	Run button : used to start the algorithm.
•	Clear button: used to clear the grid.
•	Start point button: used to place the starting node.
•	End point button: used to place the ending node.
•	Wall point: used to place walls on the grid.

 Placing the nodes:
 
 Before starting the algorithm , the user will place the starting and ending nodes on the desired locations,
 using the start and end point buttons the user will be able to change the location of the nodes on the grid.

Placing walls:
After placing the start and end nodes, the user can place wall nodes using the wall point button,
after pressing the button the program will generate walls after the users clicks on the grid,
these walls play an important role in the effectiveness of the A* search algorithm.

Visualizing the algorithm:
After pressing the run button, the program will visualize the  pathfinding process, the grid will start changing the nodes colors in the process,
going from the start to the end node, and at the end the program will show the shortest path found in blue color.

Clearing the grid:
If the user want to use the visualizer again , pressing clear would save the users time,
it will clear all the walls for the user instead of removing each individual wall,
furthermore , the program now is ready to run again and visualize the algorithm.
